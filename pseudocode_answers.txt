### Short Answer
Q: Why do programmers use pseudocode?
A: Because it helps programmers to develop algorithms

Q: If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
Programming Assignment
A: Nothing will happen

### Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

Q: Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
A:
INPUT number_1
INPUT number_2
IF the number_1 is greater than number_2 THEN
  PRINT "Number_1 greater number."
ELSE
  PRINT "Number_2 greater number."
END IF

Q: Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

A:
INIT total to 0
FOR number runs from 1 to 100
	ADD number to total
ENDFOR
RETURN total

Q: Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT a specific entry
FOR each entry in a phonebook
	IF entry is the same as a specific entry
		PRINT all information of this entry
	ENDIF
ENDFOR

Q: Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

var phonebook = [2, 5, 3, 7, 8, 10, 15, 18, 24, 111, 12, 19, 87];

function entrySearch(item) {
    for(var i=0; i < phonebook.length; i++) {
        if(phonebook[i] === item) {
            console.log("Found item " + item + " at index " + i);
            return true;
        }
    }
    //item not found 
    return false;
}
